          <h2>Enjoy Linh Phuoc Pagoda</h2>
          <p>
            Linh Phuoc Pagoda is one of the most famous temples in the country, in
            part thanks to its bell tower which stands at a height of 37 meters.
            This makes it the tallest bell tower of its kind in all of Vietnam and
            there is also a colorful central hall here which has a series of
            murals that tell the story of the life of Buddha.

          <h2>Spend the day at the Valley of Love</h2>
          <p>
            The Valley is Love is not a valley at all but actually a theme park
            that is often visited by Vietnamese couples. The park is set amidst
            lush green hills and backs on to lakes and gardens which are the
            perfect spot to have a picnic. There is an amusement park here as well
            that is staffed by locals dressed up as cowboys and you can even take
            horse or pony rides or take a swan shaped pedal boat out on one of the
            lakes.
